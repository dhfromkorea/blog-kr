				"slug": "hello-world",
				"markdown": "Welcome to my new blog LEVEL 26\\. As you can tell, the title of the blog is an actually a reference to video gaming concept: Let's say there are in total 26 \"levels\" in this blogging activity, I start with this \"tutorial level\" easy and smooth; but as the level progress, I will challenge myself with more difficult topics and stricter requirement. So hopefully when I reach the level 26 and beat the final boss called \"CMPT 376W\", I will become a quicker, smarter and better writer.  \n  \nLet's start this blog by talking about my thoughts on blogging. Why am I blogging? What am I blogging about?  \n  \nOnline blogging isn't something completely new to me. Born as a new generation, I am used to express what I have seen and thought on-line rather than on a diary book. I started my own blog on secondary school, but the objective of writing blogs has never truly about improving my writing skills. Rather, blog is simply a secret garden that I can unleash my hidden feelings in life: anger, happiness and sadness. On the same time, the desire of making elegant and fully customized blog layout had forced me to learn PHP, CSS, VPS, SSH and eventually lead me to study computing science.   \nIn the later years, my blog got my readers and the content becomes more focus on serious discussions. Yet I found myself blog less and less; I often found myself sit in front of keyboard for a while but has no idea how to start. Because now I can’t blog whatever I want, I need to think what will make readers interested in reading; and let’s be honest, with zillions YouTube videos and social media out there, making a well craft blog post the attract people’s attention is not an easy task. I always read my posts and ask myself: “If I were a reader, will I care to spend 10 minutes of my busy life to read this?” and sadly, often the answer is no.  \n  \nHowever this does not mean that blogging is no longer particle; I just need the right tool to fight it back. So with this blog and this course, I hope I learn something that I didn’t know before, and bring back the confidence and freedom once I had with writing.   \n  \nI will write all kinds of things in this blog, but mainly things that I interested in: technology, food, Japanese culture and what I learned from SFU this semester.   \n  \nAt the end of this blog entry, I want to specially thank [Jared Daley](http://jareddaley.com/376blog/). Last year, I searched cmpt376 on Google and ended up with his blog for this course. His passion in writing really moved me to take this course. I hope in the end of this semester, someone will do the same and found my blog somehow. So if you from the feature are reading this, thank you as well!",

				"markdown": "I know what's in your mind: \"Oh god, another SOPA post! I have heard enough of this! Your tiny blog that nobody is reading won't stop it anyways!\" But, hey remember that I'm here to \"practice my writing\", and there is a hot topic to discuss, so why not?  \n  \nFirst I must admit I was in luck that my essay was due on Monday, because if it is for today, there won't be Wikipedia for me to check out. Yes, you won't notice how much you relied on such a site until you lose them. I was always joking around now day's kids can't do their homework without the internet, now it turns out that I am one of them.  \n  \nWikipedia did a very brave move, they black out their English site for the world to protest against SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (Protect IP Act). As a long time reader and editor on Wikipedia, I understand how hard the decision was made. Wikipedia has always stands for natural and objective view and never involved in such a political move before. I know there are many people like myself, first thinking the whole SOPA business is just another conspiracy theory. In fact, I was laughing so hard that when I saw a video saying that YouTube can be gone from internet just because one video. \"Another one being brainwashed by internet propaganda\" I thought to myself. But when Wikipedia risks its own public image to deliver people a message, I decided to sit down and take some time to take a second look at it.  \n> Although Wikipedia’s articles are neutral, its existence is not.  \n[ A technical examination of SOPA and PROTECT IP](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html) is one good article to start with. One of the most difficult challenge we facing today in law making is the \"technical difficulty\". The online world changes so fast that the law just cannot adapt to it. And this piece of legislation is a perfect example. For example, the definition of \"foreign\" site is so vague that it clearly fails to understand that a site is not a single object that sits on one spot. In fact, some sites I build have .CA domains, but host on Linode (an US hosting Company) in its Tokyo server (to meet the speed demand of Asian visitor), are they US sites or not? There are many other places like that, but the problem here is clear: the terms and definition is unclear in a piece of law, it gives more power to law enforcement than it should.  \n  \nBut you might question: \"But we are Canadian, this is a US law, why should we care?\" Yes we should, especially for tech companies that reply on internet to make a life, because it's our sites will be the first on the blacklist. The SOPA is a clear message to declare a war against non-us website (in the name of protect IP). This is such a Déjà vu as years ago, China blocks out facebook, twiiter and other sites in the name of \"protect youth\", now the US wants to fight back (in a childish way). You may still think with the famous quote \"Those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear\", but reality won't always so fair and clear all the time. One of my sites in Chinese was blocked in china twice for no-reason, and let's face it that once a while you will put something copyrighted on the web. But more important, if this law passed, other countries won't just stay there as watch. US is the major consumer on the internet, if it decides to have the ability to block other countries' site, they sure will fight back with more laws. It will be like an arms race with no end.  \n  \nThe only way to really prevent Online Piracy is the to provide easy accessible on-line service with a reasonable price. How did iTunes make people pay while there already tons of free mp3 download sites? How did Netflex make a profit while you can find movie torrents almost anywhere? It's all about service. While these new comers have made billions of dollars from nowhere, the traditional entertainment industry still don't get this simple idea. They have tried everything but refused to change in the last 20 years. On site taken down after another, endless lawsuits have been going on, massive effort have been put into this \"holy war\" against Piracy yet no victory have been seen. Now you look at Vancouver's street, blockbuster has gone, rogers plus closed down, even HMV is one its final sale. They had such a long time to make transition but they didn't. The ones who reminds still want to fight to its last breath, they put all the money on the politician's pocket instead of making any improvement. Even if the SOPA was stopped, I'm not surprise that a new bill is on the way.       \n  \nI won't ask anyone to stop SOPA. You should not simply trust what people say on the internet (including this article). People should read about it and make their own mind.  \n  \nTo end the blog post, let me share a little useful trick: If you have an essay due tomorrow and need Wikipedia right now, just **turn off the JavaScript** in your browser. Hey, problem solved!",

				"markdown": "After I typed my title of this piece of blog post, I just realized that many phrases start with \"long\" have some sort of grammar problems. For instance, \"Long time no see\" or \"Long live the dear leader\". There are probably more examples out there, but that's off the topic. Anyways, I look back my pervious two posts, and not very impressed: they are long, dry and too serious.  So I think today is a good day to take a break, write something less serious, something totally random but contains more than four sentences.  \n  \nSo this Wednesday, I got surprisingly early despite the cold weather and lack of sleep. I checked email and SFU website, making sure school is not closed and class is not canceled. Then I went on the skytrain thought I will be on time for my IAT100 lecture in Surrey Campus for sure. What a perfect day! Well, not really. 10 minutes later I found myself stuck in Columbia station with no train coming. Apparently, the transit system broke down because skytrain's doors were frozen by snow. Great, first day of class that requires iClicker to check in and I'm going to be late. But somehow I made there in time half an hour later, but you know what's happing next: Because everyone else is still stuck on transit, not attendance was taken.   \n  \nMy twisted day didn't end here. Finished first class, I finished a quick lunch and head over to Burnaby campus.  I have two hours spare time in between I usually spend it in Gym, but I somehow forgot to bring the gym tag! So I spent 2 hours in front of the window watching nice mountain views. Finally, time for my next class. I went to the class room, grab the front seat and glad that I was the first one here. But 10 ten mintues later, I realized that something wrong here. I am still the first and only one here! I rushed out the classroom double checked the bulletin, no sign of class cancelation. I pull out my phone and log in WIFI. Well, here we go: class cancelled!  \n  \nIt turns out that: all these happing because \"I got surprisingly early\". Luckily, I'm not the only one, two more student come in with their head confused <span style=\"font-family:Wingdings;\">J</span>  \n  \nI guess it's really time for me to get some 3G data plan so I can check email constantly.  \n  \n ",

				"title": "A Taste of Naples",
				"slug": "level-4-a-taste-of-naples",
				"markdown": "Last week in class, the instructor asked the question \"Can you tell the difference between a good pizza and bad one?\". That was in fact a difficult question to me.  \n  \nPeople know me might find this surprised. Yet it is true. I can clearly tell difference between pizza-hut pizza and a more serious one (no offence to pizzahut, they actually introduced me to the delicious pizza world 20 years ago with a delicious Hawaiian). But if you ask me which one is better among my favourite pizza places, that is extreme difficult. I enjoy the crisp of a thin crust pizza but I also enjoy the richness of a deep dish pizza. Compare them is like compare apple with oranges.  \n  \nBut while you love the pizza you had all these years, have you ever thought about it:\"Does italian eat the same kind of pizza as we do?\" Recently, I come across a article called \"[World's 50 most delicious foods](http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/eat/worlds-50-most-delicious-foods-067535)  \n\" on CNN. Although the list is questionable, the \"Neapolitan pizza\" on the top 5 certainly caught my attention. That pizza on the picture looks so plain and simple, how can it be any good?  \n  \nAfter a little research on the internet, it turns out that Naples (Italy) is where it all starts. Pizza was originally a Neapolitan cuisine hundres years ago. It was enjoyed with a fork and knife instead of being sliced. Unlike today's fully loaded pizza around the world, the traditional pizza is simple with only a few freshest ingredient.  \n  \nBut how does it taste? Although the positive reviews on the net has proven something. The only I trust is my own mouth. Vancouver isn't a place lack of street side pizza stores, but talks about Neapolitan pizzas, there aren't many. I picked one among best : [Verace Pizzeria](http://www.veracepizzeria.com/) (Notice pizzeria means the places sell pizzas)  \n  \nVerace was located right besides T&amp;T supermarket in Chinatown. I have worked around here last year and pass these place every day. How did I miss it? Well it looks like a normal cafe from outside, I guess you should never judge a book by its cover.  \n  \nBefore ordering the pizza, I was first impressed by the fact that they offering sparking water for free. To start my journey of Neapolitan pizza，I ordered the most traditoanl  with a side salad ($14). According to the menu description, the pizza is made of \"Fresh plum tomato sauce, fior di latte mozzarella, finished with grana padano, fresh basil and evoo\". Let me traslate it to simpler version, it's made of best of best tomato sauce, mozzarella, grana padano(cheese), basil and oliver oil. That's sound much better, right? The Margherita is said to be named after Queen Margherita, who loves this pizza because it has the same color of Italy flag.  \n  \nThe pizza was ready with no time. I can't believe how fast it is. It is done in almost just 3 minites. According to the waiter, the pizza was baked in a 800 degree wooden oven, which can make the pizza ready in 90 seconds.  \n  \nA first bite of the pizza, I'm already fall in love with it. The crust is crisp and puffed, feeling like you are bitting a well made Naan with butters. The Mozzarella is so rich and creamy that it's just out of the world.  \n  \nBut I was in fact most impressed by the tomato sauce. I never a lover of tomato products (whole tomato, sundry tomato or Ketchup), I don't even know why they want to put tomato sauce on the pizza in the first place. (Why not BBQ sauce?) But this pizza gives me a answer. The first grade sauce made from San Marzano tomatos really makes a difference. It taste so fresh in mouth you can almost feel the warm sunshine in Italy.  \n  \n[![](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/dsc3163.jpg?w=300 \"_DSC3163\")](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/dsc3163.jpg)  \n  \nIt is a shame that they only put one basil leaf for decoration. The basil really brings out the full flavour of the pizza. And the bad part? I finished the small pizza in a few minites and still not even half full. The price made me feel kind guilty if i order one more.  \n  \nSo what's the conclusion? Does the \"authentic\" pizza really much better than what we usually have? Can I finally answer the difficult question raised in class?  \n  \nNo. They're great. But I can't say that they are better. They are just totally different food shares the same name. Neapolitan pizzas are simple and fresh, but it does not take away the deliciousness of a greedy, cheesy American pizza had brought us all these years.  \n  \nI would say give them a try yourself, although they're on the expensive side, it's the closest choice you can get besides traveling to Italy. Verace Pizzeria really gives me a taste of naples, I really enjoy it.",

				"title": "Dine Out Vancouver 2012",
				"slug": "level-5-dine-out-vancouver-2012",
				"markdown": "[Dine Out Vancouver](http://www.tourismvancouver.com/dine/dine-out-vancouver-2012/) is a annual dine out event held by the Greater Vancouver Visitors and Convention Bureau.  The idea is simple: during the 17 days of this event, hundreds of Vancouver restaurants offer $18, $28, and $38 three courses meal.  It is fantastic opportunity for people to experience a taste of fine dining (Which I assume you won't go often unless you having a date).     \n  \nYesterday was the last day of the event. I went to Ciao Bella with my new \"comrades\" from SFU cosine club. Ciao Bella is a little Italian restaurant that located on Denman St. I was a little nervous at the beginning (I don't know any one from this relatively new club yet). But it turns out pretty aright. This place is not so \"high end\" as some of our members suggest (Oh no, why did I dress in suit then!). But It is indeed relaxing, especially with warm candle light and beautiful piano performance.   \n  \nSince it's the last day of event and it's also a weekend, this place is packed with people. We stood there chatting for half an hour and finally got our reserved seats. On the other side, the waiter is very funny and friendly (He also speaks a funny Italian accent).  \n  \nThe $28 three courses meal they offer was not fancy. I chose a goat cheese salad as appetizer, chicken pasta as entrée and tiramisu as dessert.     \n  \nThe goat cheese salad (INSALATA CAPRESE) was warm and fresh. It contains \"butter lettuce, orange, Dijon vinaigrette and crumbled goat cheese\", which is a nice combination of rich and light flavors. It is interesting almost everybody else on my table orders lobster soup instead. Why? Is it because its name has \"lobster\" in it?  \n  \nI have to admit that I'm not a big fan of dining out Italian cuisine. It is not because they're not good, rather Italian cuisine is simple and elegant that you can almost make everything out of home. I don't know if you share the same feeling: When I have $20 dollars pasta in restaurant, I just can't keep thinking that I can make the same thing for much cheaper price (Despite the fact they are better). Anyway, my chicken pasta (POLLO SALTIMBOCCA) was still very delicious.  The most interesting part was that they wrapped the baked chicken piece in an Italian ham, which gives the meat two layers of texture and flavor.  \n  \nTo end the meal, the classic Italian desert Tiramisu was a must.  Ciao Bella uses cheese cake to make this desert, which gives it a much richer taste than what I used to make at home.  \n  \nThe dinner ended at 10\\. I met a lot of new people from different background and had some very interesting conversation (some people not even from SFU, how?!)  I have to be honest that I was not even half full (Somehow everyone else clam they're full). Nevertheless, it was a still a fun experience over all.    \n  \nSome food lovers always claim that we should not value quantity over quality, but for my support of cheap, casual eating still haven't changed.  Fine dining is not better, but different. It offers the mood and services that cheap one can't; It is not just about food any more.",

				"markdown": "Last week, Blizzard hands out 100,000 diablo 3 beta keys. It sounds like a big number, but compare to millions of fans that have been waited for so long, it isn't much. I was lucky enough to have one of them. After playing it from here to there though the week, I think I can share some thought about it.  \n  \nFirst of all, let me share a little story. Last Friday, I got the key from an email Blizzard send out.  I was so excited.  By that time, I have an essay still need to be finished. Also I have a CMPT 376 lecture to attend at school. So I put down my work and fire up the game immediately. By the end of the day, guess what happened? I finished the essay and attended the class.   \n  \nI know, for those don't play games, you already lost: \"What does this suppose to mean?\" But all the people who have waited for this game, they must be screaming right now: \"How can it be?!\" Diablo is a game that supposes to kill your entire social life and school work.  Once you get your hands on it, you are not supposed to put it down. When the last game came out, millions of people spend endless long nights on it.  \n  \nSo was this game a disappointing?  Not really. This game feels exactly like the old one. It has great detail in graphic. The fighting animation is smooth and realistic. The loot (which is one of the main points of the game) has endless variations. It comes out exactly like what I dreamed about 10 years ago!  \n  \nThen what went run? Why am I not getting more exciting as I slice enemies into pieces? Why don't I feel like to continue to next when I finished the last one?  \n  \nI finally figured out after a while: The game hasn't changed, but I already did. It's has been 10 years, the design of video game has changed so much. While I played them one by one, I have become more picking. 10 years ago, there is no game can compare to diablo 2; but now, with so many games release everyday, there are so many to choose from, diablo 3 no longer give me the same level of excitement.    \n  \nIt is interesting to see how people change tastes over time. And it's also interesting how people's \"good memory\" can create a bias over subjects. My father always told me that how boring my generations; how fun they used to play Hopscotch on the ground. But after he tried my video games, he never went back.  \n  \nDiablo 3 is great, its developer listen to the fans, and made something just like they wanted. But for me, a game that just keeping clicking mouse buttons and collect loots just not satisfying any more.",

Just a week ago, nobody has heard about this name, but now it's the hottest topic on the street (and the internet). Jeremy is so popular that people even created a world for this phenomenon:  \"Linsainity\".  \n  \nSo who is this guy? Let me give you a short version: he is Asian; he went to Harvard study economics; and he is now a NBA player. Jeremy scored record-breaking 136 points in his first five career starts (for those who know nothing about Basketball: that's a lot), which makes him the hottest rising star in the league.   \n  \nYet, what make him insanely popular isn't how skilled he is, but rather his existence is a total **anti-stereotype**. The NBA league is always dominated by African Americans. People just don't expect Asian people to perform the same. Sure Yao Ming was popular for a while, but deeply inside, people still think he is good because he was born with a 7 ft 6 in body. Yet Lin was different, he was an \"underdog\". He was not particular tall (6 ft 3 in); all the team he served put him on the bench. If it wasn't his teammates got injured, his talent will still be unknown to the world.  \n  \nWhat really interesting is how people react to this \"Linsanity\".  Besides those who truly admire Lin's basketball ability, there are many be proud of him for other \"reasons\". For example, religious group claim that he was good because his faith of god. Taiwanese people waive their flags in the court for Lin is a Taiwanese descent; meanwhile, mass media in China already flood the TV news that Lin is the \"pride of china\".  \n  \nIt's kind sad to see this happening, but it's unavoidable. I really hope Lin can stay humble like the way he is now, and play the best he can for the rest of the season.",

				"markdown": "No, I'm not talking about some place in Mountain View you can get yourself drunk and leave a prototype android phone behind. I'm talking about the navigation bar on the top of google page.  \n  \nIn less than a year, Google has changed the design of the bar three times. Three is a significant large number for a page that billions people visit everyday. What's going on?  \n  \nWell, ever since **Larry Page **took over the CEO position of Google. The company had done great amount changes on user interfaces of is products. Much like what Microsoft and Apple has been doing all the years, a simpler, prettier and more elegant look was designed to do a face lift of the old and boring Google page. To be honest, as a Graphic designer, I like how it looks now just by a glance. It's modern and fresh. But the more I use them, the more I actually dislike the re-design: the look is not the only thing changed, so did the functionality and user experience. It might be an ok or even great design overall for other companies, but for a internet giant like Google: it is just **horrible**.  \n  \nOne great example is the Google Bar. The top navigation used to be nothing but a bunch of links. In [last year's first re-design roll out](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/evolving-google-design-and-experience.html), Google decided to gives it a touch up. Along with other new designs, they painted the bar in black background and white font. The current page is indicated by a stylish red line on the tab's top. In addition, they added some new notification system on the right to accompany their new \"Google+\" platform.  \n  \nI liked the design. It still has the simple feeling Google always had. And it is very functional without using too much space. The user-experience hasn't changed much as well. Most people like it as well.  \n  \nBut just a few months later, [Google doesn't like it anymore](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/next-stage-in-our-redesign.html). They claimed that the design \"takes precious space of the page\", and replaced it with a two level drop down menu hidden within the Google logo. The idea sounds great; it makes the page event cleaner and very content focusing. But when you start to using it, you will know that it is the most terrible industrial web design you have ever seen.  \n  \nIt's just so much more complex to use. You want to go to \"image\" tab, hover the cursor to the Google logo, and select \"image\" from the drop-down list. Not so bad right? But what about \"Video\"? You go to the logo, the video is not there. Now you need move your mouse to the \"more\" button and more options jumps out. **Three **mouse movement just for a link that used to be one click away. That's a lot time wasted for an action that billons user perform every day. The worst part comes when you want to switch in-between tabs. Users like me search for things that unfamiliar might want to check text, image and video. Then I have to do these actions over and over again. It's just wrong.  \n  \nLuckily Google heard people's complain, and in this[ third changes](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/update-on-google-bar.html), brought the well-received black navigation bar back. However, they did something different this time. First they replaced the \"Video\" search with a \"Youtube\" search. A decision that favoring their own products over others. It's ok in my option, but Youtube still looks so different from other google products, which breaks the uniform of the design. Then they moved the Google + Notificion down, taking another minimal 29px height space. Why? I just don't understand this. I'm pretty sure google knows how small screen user will hate this, but here it is.  \n  \nIt seems to me Google's UI team is just rushing on their re-design. They don't even do split test before releasing to the public. Or maybe they simply using the public as their free beta testers. Sadly, this is what happen when a company monopoly the market: they can do whatever they want to their site, because no matter you like it or not, you have to use it.",

But none of them were anything closer to the interview I had today.  \n  \nThis company, let's called it HW, is located somewhere near commercial drive and main st. It starts merely 2 years ago and already making some nice profit. A little online research shows that the founder was from SFU too. What a small world! We had a nice conversation on the phone; so far everything went OK and normal.  \n  \nThings become interesting when the in person interview begins. I suddenly realized that I am not the only one having an interview at the same time! Jack, a humble guy from SFU, became my \"partner\" during the interview. We answer some question individually (but we can hear each other), and we even need to work out some questions on paper together.  \n  \nThe question going wired from the first one.  \n> What's the next two letters for the sequence: \"AM JJ AS __\"?  \nGreat, an IQ test like pattern searching. But what's the pattern? I don't see it! While we were pulling out our hair trying to figure this out, the interviewer suddenly starts to talk about 4 month and 8 month working period contract. How distracting! Wait! Month? Yes month! I suddenly figured it out: **A**pril **M**ay **J**une **J**uly **A**ugust **S**eptember … So the next two letters are **O** and **N**!  \n  \nThe next question was a little bit simple, \"why manholes are round?\" I know it's supposed to test how smart I am, but I already know the answer since childhood. Manholes are round so they don't easily fall down.  \n  \nThe third question asks me to estimate the cost of cleaning the whole Vancouver's window. The correct answer was \"$5 per window\". I don't really like it, as the question was misleading.  \n  \nSo question like this comes one after another. I don't know how to solve most of them. But I did my best to describe my thought process, hoping I can leave a good impression.  \n  \nNonetheless, the interview is one of the most fun one I had. I always thought only Company like Google ask those \"none sense\" questions to test your problem solving skills, it turns out I was wrong. It's a priceless experience.",

				"markdown": "KONY 2012 has been extremely popular recently. The video made by Invisible Children has been viewed billions of times on YouTube. Their goal of “making Joseph Kony famous” has been accomplished: [Joseph Kony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony) is now a name that every household knows about.  \n  \nUnlike many others, I'm still not so interested in “spreading the love” to Uganda. Honestly, I can't even pin Uganda in a map. However, I noticed that the film itself is a work of genius. It demostrated that how a cleverly craft work can manipulate people's mind. It's a propaganda masterpiece.  \n  \nPropaganda is used to be a tool that can be only used by the government, it required the main stream to repeat the same idea over and over again. But today, anyone can do it with help of the new born social media.  \n  \nWhy KONY 2012 is a piece of propaganda? I have been lived in China for most half of my life. It's a country that this technique is used everyday. I know them too well. When a film tells you that millions of death and years of conflicts is just one man's fault. When they let you believe that Kony is nothing but a pure evil man. You can tell that it's something that trying to blind your vision and confusing your mind.  \n  \nYet with such a obvious bias in the film, how come people still jumping into its trap? That's because it's carefully crafted to making you want to believe. There are few interesting techniques you can learn from this video.  \n  \n1.  **Making connection with your audiences**: the film is targeting the American viewer, therefore they used a lot of comparison between Uganda and US. Such a contraction creates dramatic impact on the viewers, making them feel guilty about the good life they are enjoying.  \n2.  **Using small child as examples**. Children is always the softest spot in people's heart. The film features a Africa kid “Jacob” and the director's son. Again, the contraction does the magic here, bring down the last defence of every man's heart.  \n3.  **Lie with statics**. Nobody going to check the numbers mentions in the film, after such a powerful 27 mins, everyone just assume that they are nothing but truth. However, statics always lies. Experts have pointed out that many numbers used in the film is inaccurate, but people don't care.  \nThe truth never matters, people always believe what they want to believe. In war time or peace time, the basic idea never changes. With the advance of social media, KONY 2012 shows us that anyone can spread their messages with the right techniques.",

I understand that branching a story is time consuming task. But if choices player makes doesn't matter anymore, what's the point? Just don't give me one then!  \n  \nI hope there is no Mass Effect 4 planned in EA's money making agenda . The soul of Bioware's game is already dead, just leave them in peace.",

				"markdown": "This semester, I had an evening class in Downtown SFU every thursday. The class is a boring 3 hours long lecture, the only motivation that drives me is Downtown's food. After every class, we found some places in the area to have a dinner (I know, it's kinda late). The good thing about Downtown is, there are so many choices to choose from. You will never get bored.  \n  \nLast thursday, we heard about a new restaurant \"Kita No Donburi\" just opened right besides SFU downtown. Donburi, for those not familiar with, is a Japanese dish that features meat or other toppings on top of rice. I'm big donburi fan, and there wasn't many Vancouver restrants are dicated to such a dish (I know one, but they don't server tradition ones but rather fusion ones). So we decided to have a taste.  \n  \nThe store closes at 9PM. We got there around 8:15, just about time.  My friend wants to try there **[croquette](https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;biw=1050&amp;bih=633&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JKdiT4qDLuGXiQKyv63SCA&amp;ved=0CBkQvwUoAQ&amp;q=croquette&amp;spell=1) (deep fried potato meat ball), **guess what, they told us they're sold out. I noticed something funny written on the wall: \"pizza sushi\". So I asked for one. Aagin, they don't have it. So we have to stick with the basic donburi menus.  \n  \nTo try out any resturant that serves donburi, I always order Kastu don (deep fried pork ) first. It's simple but complex in the same time. Every store has the different style to do it. Some are cripy and others are not. It's the best way to tell a chief's skill.  \n  \nMy friend ordered kyu don, which is thin sliced beef on top of the rice.  Both dishes was served quickly to the table. And it was not bad, the potion is not huge for the price, but that's what you can get in downtown area （hint, their rent is expensive). The beef was tender and the fried pork is not crispy but still delicous.  \n  \nBut then we noticed a small thing. The Kyu don is supposed to have an egg on top of it. But it didn't. When we walk out the restaurant, we checked out the display window. The sample dish of kyu don also has an egg on it. \"Maybe they just forgot\".  \n  \n[![](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsc6564.png?w=300 \"_DSC6564\")](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsc6564.png)  \n  \nToday we went to this restaurant again (just because it's so close), this time we ordered kakuni (pork bell slices) don. It's not many japanese restaurant here have this dish, maybe because the pork takes hours to cook. Again, the menu says it has an egg with it, but it didn't!  \n  \nWe were puzzled, maybe an egg is too expensive this days that this new restaurant can not afford it. Or maybe vancouver doesn't have a quality egg to meet the Japanese standard.  \n  \nWhatever the reason is, we didn't ask for it. An egg doesn't worth our time to argue with people after a 3 hour lecture, but we are never coming back to this place again.",

Compare to two years ago, my programming knowledge has improved a lot, my work experience has gown to 8 months, and my GPA even has a little boost. But after a few unsuccessful interviews, I started question my self. Maybe I should started thinking about other alternatives. Maybe taking a few classes in summer wasn't that bad.  \n  \nBy the time I was struggle, Professor Ted come to rescue.  In my writing class, he introduced the new \"design SFU mobile\" course.  Oh god, a 15 credits courses! And not to mention that it has 9 upper divisions computer science credits! But most importantly, this is the kind of courses I always liked. Small class room, group work, no final, no exams. Simply working together to some common goal. After I went to the information sections, I applied as soon as possible. I was over confidence again, I got mobile development experience, there is no way they won't choose me.  \n  \nBut after the self-recommendation was sent. Again, a long waiting while nothing happens. I was depressed again. Maybe I wasn't that good after all. They only select 8 people from computing science, how can it be me? I started to apply more co-op jobs again. Luck was on my side this time.  Just after I had a great interview with a start-up mobile development company(Let's call it company W), I got the an email in my inbox: “Congratulations! You have been accepted into the design SFU mobile course! Please reply this email if you are going to confirm the enrollment\"  \n  \nOh dear, the joy was overwhelming my head. My replied \"Yes!\" without a second thought. However, just after I clicked the \"send\" button. Another email went in. \"Congratulations! You have been offered a CO-OP job in summer. It going to be $2800/month for 8 months\"  \n  \nOh no! That's exactly the words pops out my head. \"$2800!\" and it's a mobile development company, which means real work experience with mobile industry!  Suddenly I felt a little regret about the letter I just replied. Both of them are great opportunities, which one should I choose? (I could still send another email to cancel my confirmation) The design SFU mobile course is very interesting, it's a learning experience I always dreamed about. But there is a lot of uncertain elements in this course as well. The content of the course has not been set, not even the schedule. If I doing poorly in this course, 15 credits can let my GPA fall like a snow ball. On the other hand, the job wasn't so certain as well. The company just started weeks ago, their up-coming products sound interesting but can be  not profitable guaranteed . Working on their 8 months can be risky choice.  \n  \nGod, this is the first sleep-less night I spent for something not bad but too good. How can I be offered two equal opportunities at the same time? Is this a joke from the God? But by the morning of the second day, I finally made my decision. The working experience is valuable, but I can always get one later in my life. However, my university life is ending soon,  maybe it's ok to enjoy myself to something I really wanted to. After all, I already replied \"Yes\" and I wanted to keep my promise. Trues me, this isn't an easy decision, especially thinking of the \"$2800/month\" part, this is the best offer I have ever got.  \n  \nI replied the company with my apology and refused the offer (The co-op office certainly confused and wasn’t so happy about that lol). I hope I have made the correct choice (but you never know), and would have a fun summer.",

But what do you expect me to do? It's just so close to SFU harbor center. After a 3 hour lecture in the evening, and with so many assignment due, it's the best bet we can have.  \n  \nToday, kita no sushi's shortage of the food on their menu is no better. I asked for \"Yakiniku\" (Stone BBQ meat) and guess what: they don't have it. So I remember last time I ordered the suspicious \"pizza sushi\" and it wasn't there. Without much hope, I still asked: \"What about Pizza sushi?\" The cashier was confused for a few seconds, as if she has never heard their own dishes. But she finally replied \"Yes we have that.\" What? I can't believe my ears and asked again: “Now? Pizza sushi? You sure?\" and she confirmed.  \n  \n[![](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc6909.png?w=300 \"_DSC6909\")](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc6909.png)  \n  \nI was a little excited. Trying something new is always exciting for me. What would pizza sushi looks like? Cheese and salami on the top of the sushi? Baked? I can't stop smile while imagination these creepy creations. After all, it only cost $5.5, in a store right at heart of downtown: I have to lower my expectation.  \n  \nWhen the dish finally arrive to my table, I can't believe my owns eyes! It's amazing. It's the most colorful dish I have been seen in a while. The plate is fully loaded with chopped tuna and salmon spicy sashimi. On the second layer, there is a lot of green salad dressed with Japanese salad sauce. The surprise comes in the bottom, which is a round fried rice pan cake. It's crispy and tasty. Every thing is mixed so well together as if it's a dish that has been practiced for years. To best describe it, it's more like a advanced version of Chirashi sushi.  \n  \n[![](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc6905.png?w=300 \"_DSC6905\")](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc6905.png)  \n  \nI know, this place is meant for donburi eatings.

It has the most elgent decroation I have ever seen. The wall is painted in red, giving it a rich and warm Chinese flavour. Yet some green plants were hang on the wall, making the whole theme a great contrast. There are few candles on the table, buring slowly with yellow frames.

Just like I'm not a big fan of Chinese owned Sushi bars, the idea of Korean owned Chinese food gives me a little disapointment. But later we found out that it's actually a type of korean food called \"Korean Chinese cuisine\", so it's like French fries in US, Italian Pizza in Canada.

Well, it's a restaurant on roboson, what did I expecet? We ordered the recommened \"Spicy glass noodle soup\" ($12.99) in the end. It was not bad, spicy and full of flaouvrs. The noodles is especially good. It has a chowy texture that keep you want to have another bite.  \n  \n[![](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc6745.jpg?w=300 \"SONY DSC\")](http://level26.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dsc6745.jpg)  \n  \nIf you like to explore new food like me, this is defnitely a place you should try out.",

Yes, people now already give up film to digital, but other than that, everything is the same. The camera looks the same, feels the same and works the same.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nRecently I bought a 50mm lens from Ebay for 50 bucks. When I plug it easily into my new miorrless camera, I realized that there isn't much improvement over the photo taking process. After I took the picture, I need plug my SD card into my computer; then instead of using the dark room, I process my pictures one by one in Photoshop. Adjust the exposure, enhance the color and so on. Finally I can upload the best picture I took to flickr and share the link to twitter or facebook.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nIt sounds very ordinary for every digital photographer outer there. But think about it from a non-photographer, think about it from a guy only took picture from his smart-phones. He might ask: why is this so complicated? Indeed, the overall process is just so complicated from create to shared a single picture. Digital camera, especially DSLRs, is such pieces of complex digital equipment. Yet talks about their software, they are totally crap. I don't see any software difference between a new camera and a ten-year old one. You got a little browsing option, some default scene selections and a few boring tricks and that's it. Nothing has changed over the past 10 years while smartphones’ software almost reaches the level of personal computers.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nThe digital cameras are dying. But it's their own fault. Image quality shouldn't be the only thing they care about. People expect more from a expensive equipment. Maybe one day, they will notice this (and let's hope it's not too late). Maybe one day, my camera will do complex digital editing just like computer, and can be connected to the internet just like smart phones.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \nI hope the day will come.",

But I just couldn't make it due to its limited business hours: It opens only Monday to Friday from 8am to 3pm. I couldn't get up as early as 8, and my last class ends at 4:30\\. Whenever I had a break from National holidays, they will have a break too :( It just seems to be a place I will never reach.  \n  \nBut my chances finally come as today's morning lecture was canceled. Without a second thought, I went to Chez Meme as early as I can. Surprisingly, this place is usually packed during lunch time. But on the morning, no body is there.  Some may say that it's too much for breakfast, but I ordered the most \"meaty\" dish anyways. This might be my only chance in this year!  \n  \nI ordered a Lamb Shank Baguette. It was slow cooked lamb shank with French toast. For $10.50, it also comes with fries, salad or daily soup of your choice. As I said above, this is what people usually get for lunch, but I don't care.  \n  \nThe Baguette was amazing. The lamb meat is melting in my mouth. Even the toast taste 10 times better than what I brought from Safeway. (They're not bad). The soup of the day is creamy mushroom. It's thick and rich in flavor. I like it lot.  \n  \nIn the end, I was too full for lunch this day. But it is indeed a great meal that worth its price. Later, I heard that the reason of the store's strange business hours is because the owner wants to spend more time with their two children. If that's true, I would totally understand that with full respect: No body loves anything better than their kids.",

Buy the way, I was number 6 in my class in a Number 1 school in town, not bad huh?  \n  \nIn canada, because people care so much about \"other's feeling\", ranking system would never be there.

On this day, people simply have fun and enjoy themselves!  \n  \nThis years april fools day is a Google day, all their stuff went mad making some serious good jokes. [Google bar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re0VRK6ouwI), a enery bar made by Google Fiber. And [Gmail Tap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KhZKNZO8mQ), a brand two finger input method. And [multi-task mode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiLSiqyDf4Y) for google chrome.  \n  \nBut their Japanese division takes that much further, first 1 finger input method, then they realeased a [8-bit google map](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rznYifPHxDg) for NES that you can actually play! Oh, god. Nothing is better than this for a Video game fan. If you have ever played dragon quest or something similar, your tear is pulling down like me. Fight a dragon on the map of Vancouver? Nothing is more epic than this.  \n  \nYet there are some joke I don't like about. A typical is a \"show your love to someone\". The idea is, if you're rejected by the girl/boy, you can just say \"oh it's just a joke!\" So people can still be friends? Seriously, if you don't have the courage to show your heart, just don't do it! This is not a joke!  \n  \nThe ugly part is that making jokes about people's death. This is not funny at all. I still remmber years ago when a Hong Kong film star dies at April 1st, no one going to bieleve that.  \n  \nHow sad was that.  \n  \nAnyway I hoped you enjoyed your holiday.",

I have to admit that this is the course I enjoyed most this semester (Sorry CMPT 363), a class about design, project based, group work related. Just like what I was expected.  \n  \nGetting into IAT100 is not easy, in fact, I spent my four years in SFU finally able to get in from a wait list position. The system was a crap, I was in waitlist before anyone else can select the course, but when the cap was lifted, those people spaming their browsers getting first.  \n  \nBut nontheless, I get in in the end. The class is about basic design principle. I already know most because I was in a design class in High School. The first project is about Photography basics. This is where made I pick up my camera again. Hell, I even bought a tripod just for that. Simply apply rule of third, my picture is 10x better now.  \n  \nThe second project is making a live-action comic. It's even better. I shot an entire comic just by myself and a tripod. But after apply photoshop filters to it, it looks like real comic book. By the way, the story was based on [Ballad of a mother's heart](http://funstuff.forummotion.com/t50-ballad-of-a-mother-s-heart). It's a heart breaking story, I highly recommend you read it.  \n  \nThe final project is making a motion graphic. It's like an animation, but more about how to choose camera angels, how to cut and transition. Not really about the animation part. I was going to it myself, but some girls in class ask me to join their group. There is no way I refuse that :) Luckly, I know After Effect for a long time, so it's not a big deal for me. Still, I learned a lot more than I knew, such as using the puppet tool, which can make things move like a puppet! But the greatest thing about this is that I made some friends that I will never be in Computing Scince courses.  \n  \nOverall, I enjoy the course a lot. It was always regard as easiest course in SFU. The work load is not easy at all. But the marks are certainly easy. If you are interested in art and digital desigm, I would certainly recommend you to take it (if you can). But somethings you might feel discouraged as you work so hard and get a A+ and someone didn't do so well still get a A-. (Because the finall product doesn't matter in this course, they just check if you applied the concepts learned in class.)",

I'm not sure I did, maybe because it's baker who teachest it, or maybe because I want a 3 hour class at night so I can have more free time play PS3.  \n  \nAnyway, the work load of this class is actually pretty lite. But the content is mind blowing. In this course you learn 3 new programing languages. Before I took it, I think what's the big deal? I learned python, java, c, c++, javascript, PHP before, these is nothing I can't handle! All programing languages are the same!  \n  \nI was wrong. The first thing we learned is Haskell, it's a pure functional language, which means there is no loop, and no varibales! Oh god, how am I suppose to write anything with this? But in the end, it shows that you can. In fact, it takes much less words to desrible the same problem.  The key to this puzzle: recursions. Everything is done in recursions, it's elegent yet brain killing.  \n  \nWhile I thought Haskell is hard enought, then we meet Prolog in the second part. At first glance, it looks just like Haskell. Pattern matching and everything. But god, it's nothing like Haskell at all! It's a logic programing language that can only define truth relationships between things. Somehow it's more like a SQL query. But the sytax just want to to die when it comes to nested recursions. Your brain has to think completely differently in order to solve it.  \n  \nBaker says that we would become a better programmer after learning these. I certainlly agree. After reading all these things, reading python code like a piece of cake! They're so clear and lovely!  \n  \nOne complain about the course is that is about programing but it's exam based. I hate nothing more than writing code in paper. I just can not do it!",

As from designer's view, it's very diffcult to comment that is bad. In fact, the new design matches every design priciple you learned from a design book.  \n  \n![](http://dribbble.com/system/users/2645/screenshots/474509/plusone.png?1331923394 \"http://dribbble.com/system/users/2645/screenshots/474509/plusone.png?1331923394\")  \n  \nThe new button has a strongest contrast color you can find, white and red. Very classic design that you find in Gmail, Coke and canada national flags. The new button also addes a \"g\" letter on it, which increases the brand effect: it's not just any +1 button, it's a google plus one button.  \n  \nHell, on the designer's page, he posted a draft veersion and everyone likes it! But then why it doesn't work in pratice?  \n  \nThe answer is fact very simple: it's red. Google's most product, beside Gmail, is always have a blue theme. Look at your buttons, links, they're always blue. So when google suddenly descide change Google+'s theme red, people's eyes can't adpat the new design. Everything become so bright and distructing the real content.  \n  \nThis is a great lesson shows that \"deisgn by the book\" won't always work.
